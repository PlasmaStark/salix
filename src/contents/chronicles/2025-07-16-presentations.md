Everyone can end up giving a confusing or dull presentation - it happens, and it will happen. This list is meant as a practical checklist to help reduce that chance.

It began at **Eurocrypt 2023**, in Lyon, where I started jotting down what made some talks fall flat. Over time it grew with observations from both others’ mistakes and my own. I found myself searching my list and referring back to it quite often, so this time I decided to write it down properly, with better wording and clearer ideas.

This is not meant to be a precise guide, which would perhaps be impossible to write, but rather a short list of ideas to reflect on.


## Before you start

Good communication comes down to three key phases: understanding your target audience, choosing your content, and delivering your presentation.

The first is crucial: you need to understand your audience, their background, and how to connect with them. The second follows: even if you already have a topic, it still needs to be shaped to them. The third is the live moment, where delivery and clarity make or break your presentation. We will mainly focus on the last two.


## Choosing your content

You probably already have a topic in mind, but it needs to be shaped to fit the target audience. Always keep the goal of the presentation in mind. 

There’s a large difference between being invited to present your own work and being invited to present your field. Not every talk is about showcasing your _results_. Sometimes, it’s about sharing your _understanding_ — be mindful of that. This is perhaps the cardinal sin of presentations.

- **You're not writing a paper**: Prioritize clarity over completeness. Mention ideas, but avoid diving into unnecessary details just because you feel you'd miss out.
- **Aim for the sweet spot**: Your talk should feel _“easy”_ to those with little background, while still signaling depth and deliberate simplification to those who know the topic well.
- **Guide, don’t overwhelm**: Use examples. Avoid full rigor and think pedagogically.
- **Tell stories**: If you can relate the topic to something real (an application, a failure, a moment in history...) do it. It breaks monotony and helps retention. 
- **Plan for chaos**: Conditions will rarely be ideal. Be ready to skip, trim, or expand content depending on how things unfold.


## Building your slides 

Many fall apart at this stage, which is arguably the most crucial. Here you step into your audience’s shoes, and use what you learned about them to shape and deliver your content as effectively as possible.

This holds for any material (handouts, for instance), but especially for slides.

- **Roughly one slide per minute**: This is just a rule of thumb, but remember to never exaggerate. Your best slide might be the one you never show.
- **Avoid showing the total slide count**: If the audience got lost, seeing "Slide 7/54" will probably make them stop listening and start counting. Ponder about avoiding this.
- **Consistency makes life easier**: Do not use walls of text: mind spacing, and visuals. Slides are there for *support*, not reading. Layouts, colors, and notation should not distract or confuse.
- **Recap often**: People zone out. Gently remind them what you’ve said and why it matters. Adding little recaps or "take aways" once in a while can work wonders.
- **Plan for chaos (2)**: Be ready to skip or adjust content on the fly without breaking the narrative. Since you already know the material, rehearsals will naturally feel smoother and faster. Even if you don't rehearse, always increase your expected timing by 10–20%. 


## The presentation

Once you're on stage, things will move quickly. Delivering a good talk means staying calm, being clear, and reading the room as you go. Trust the work you've done. 

- **Don't rush**: Speaking too fast will confuse the audience and hurt clarity, especially if you're not presenting in your mothertongue. Take your time.
- **The audience exists**: Try not to stare at your slides. Keep some level of eye contact and watch for puzzled expressions, they’re cues for adjusting your pace or rephrasing.
- **Be ready to adapt**: If you notice confusion or time slipping away, skip or compress gracefully. You don’t need to go over everything to reach your goal.
- **A clever ending**: Avoid ending on just a dull "Thank you". While it is polite to keep that in, light joke, visual pun, or clever callback gives a more memorable and human finish.


## Conclusion

At the end of the day, a talk is a shared moment. Make it worth both your time and theirs. Trust your work, respect your audience, and things will fall into place.
