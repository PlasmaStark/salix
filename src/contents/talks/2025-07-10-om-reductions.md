## Abstract

This presentation was part of the 2025 edition of the self-study PhD course _Cryptographic
Proof Techniques_ by Prof. Elena Pagnin (Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden). I thank her for the valuable comments and invaluable patience.

The handout includes theoretical details from cited literature and the formalisation of some personal remarks and doubts. The ones I managed to solve, of course.

## Notes

The current version was updated on 2025-07-11 with the great feedback received during the presentation, which improved it a lot.
