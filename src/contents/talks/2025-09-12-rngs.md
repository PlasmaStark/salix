## Abstract

Random number generation is an often overlooked cornerstone for secure communications, cryptographic protocols, and scientific simulations.  
We will survey the NIST framework for random bit generation (SP 800-90A/B/C, SP 800-22), highlighting how entropy sources, deterministic generators, and statistical validation form a structured foundation for practice.  
We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities of quantum entropy sources through an ongoing project for distributed infrastructures at INFN, showcasing how this area is a potential of multidisciplinary collaboration between engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and cryptographers.

## Notes

The target is an advanced audience interested in the applied side of cryptography. It was the introduction to the [*Quantum Number Generators and Cryptogrpahy* workshop](https://www.decifris.it/cifris25/workshops#QRN) at [Cifris25](https://www.decifris.it/cifris25).

We thank our collaborators at INFN computing facilities for their contributions and discussions on practical deployment issues.  
This presentation is also indebted to the valuable feedback received from the _Cryptographic Standards_ community, which greatly improved the clarity of the material.
