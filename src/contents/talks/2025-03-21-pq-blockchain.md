## Abstract

This talk introduces the notion of quantum-resistance for cryptographic signatures and its implications for the blockchain panorama for students at the XRP Commons Acquarium residence.

After a brief introduction, we will discuss the state of the signature standardization process, including the USA NIST calls. The presentation will conclude by highlighting the joint effort between University of Trento and Ripple Labs.

## Notes

This talk was part of the event [_Cryptography at work for blockchain_](https://www.eventbrite.fr/e/cryptography-at-work-for-blockchain-tickets-1280720753249), held at XRP Commons Paris.
