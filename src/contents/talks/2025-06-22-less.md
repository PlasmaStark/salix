## Abstract

**LESS** (**L**inear **E**quivalence **S**ignature **S**cheme) is a digital signature scheme relying on the hardness of the _Linear Code Equivalence Problem_, perhaps the first code-based scheme not relying on a variant of the _Syndrome Decoding Problem_.

This talk explores the foundations, construction, and security of LESS. We also discuss upgrades such as LESS-F, LESS-M, and CF-LESS, and how group actions provide a unifying language to describe its functionality.

## Notes

This talk was part of the course _Post Quantum Cryptography_ by Daniele Friolo (Universit√† La Sapienza), who I thank for the great occasion and even greater course. 

## Material

- [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19uwKkJLX3kQtApz-vGDA-znxEM37OM36/view)  
- [paper (LESS v2)](https://www.less-project.com/LESS-2025-02-07.pdf)  

## Bibliography

Much of the content builds on the work _LESS is More: Code-Based Signatures Without Syndromes_ by Biasse, Micheli, Persichetti, and Santini. The follow-up technical analysis and upgrades (e.g., LESS-FM, CF-LESS) are documented in successive papers and preprints between 2021 and 2025. Additional theoretical background on the hardness of code equivalence can be found in works by Barenghi et al. and Chou et al. All citations are on the respective slides.
