## Abstract

**LESS** (**L**inear **E**quivalence **S**ignature **S**cheme) is a digital signature scheme relying on the hardness of the _Linear Code Equivalence Problem_, perhaps the first code-based scheme not relying on a variant of the _Syndrome Decoding Problem_.

This talk explores the foundations, construction, and security of LESS. We also discuss upgrades such as LESS-F, LESS-M, and CF-LESS, and how group actions provide a unifying language to describe its functionality.

## Notes

This talk was part of the course _Post Quantum Cryptography_ by Daniele Friolo (Universit√† La Sapienza), who I thank for the great occasion and interesting course.
